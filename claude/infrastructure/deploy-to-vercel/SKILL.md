# Deploy to Vercel

Deploy any project to Vercel. **Always deploy as preview** (not production) unless the user explicitly asks for production.

The goal is to get the user into the best long-term setup: their project linked to Vercel with git-push deploys. Every method below tries to move the user closer to that state.

## Step 1: Gather Project State

Run all checks before deciding which method to use:

```bash
# 1. Check for a git remote
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null

# 2. Check if locally linked to a Vercel project (either file means linked)
cat .vercel/project.json 2>/dev/null || cat .vercel/repo.json 2>/dev/null

# 3. Check if the Vercel CLI is installed and authenticated
vercel whoami 2>/dev/null

# 4. List available teams (if authenticated)
vercel teams list --format json 2>/dev/null

# 5. Check for token-based auth (VERCEL_TOKEN in env or .env files)
printenv VERCEL_TOKEN
grep '^VERCEL_TOKEN=' .env 2>/dev/null

# 6. Check for project/org IDs in environment
printenv VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
printenv VERCEL_ORG_ID
```

### Token-Based Authentication

If `vercel whoami` fails (no interactive login), look for a `VERCEL_TOKEN` before falling back to the no-auth deploy scripts. Work through these scenarios in order:

#### A) `VERCEL_TOKEN` is already set in the environment

```bash
printenv VERCEL_TOKEN
```

If this returns a value, you're ready. Skip to Step 2.

#### B) Token is in a `.env` file under `VERCEL_TOKEN`

```bash
grep '^VERCEL_TOKEN=' .env 2>/dev/null
```

If found, export it:

```bash
export VERCEL_TOKEN=$(grep '^VERCEL_TOKEN=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)
```

#### C) Token is in a `.env` file under a different name

Look for any variable that looks like a Vercel token (Vercel tokens typically start with `vca_`):

```bash
grep -i 'vercel' .env 2>/dev/null
```

Inspect the output to identify which variable holds the token, then export it as `VERCEL_TOKEN`:

```bash
export VERCEL_TOKEN=$(grep '^<VARIABLE_NAME>=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)
```

#### D) No token found — ask the user

If none of the above yield a token, ask the user to provide one. They can create a Vercel access token at vercel.com/account/tokens.

---

**Important:** Once `VERCEL_TOKEN` is exported as an environment variable, the Vercel CLI reads it natively — **do not pass it as a `--token` flag**. Putting secrets in command-line arguments exposes them in shell history and process listings.

```bash
# Bad — token visible in shell history and process listings
vercel deploy --token "vca_abc123"

# Good — CLI reads VERCEL_TOKEN from the environment
export VERCEL_TOKEN="vca_abc123"
vercel deploy
```

### Project and Org IDs from Environment

If `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are both set in the environment, the CLI uses them automatically and skips any `.vercel/` directory. This lets you deploy without running `vercel link` first.

```bash
export VERCEL_ORG_ID="<org-id>"
export VERCEL_PROJECT_ID="<project-id>"
```

Note: `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` must be set together — setting only one causes an error.

**If you have a project URL** (e.g. `https://vercel.com/my-team/my-project`), extract the team slug:

```bash
echo "$PROJECT_URL" | sed 's|https://vercel.com/||' | cut -d/ -f1
```

### Team Selection

If the user belongs to multiple teams, present all available team slugs as a bulleted list and ask which one to deploy to. Once the user picks a team, proceed immediately to the next step — do not ask for additional confirmation.

Pass the team slug via `--scope` on all subsequent CLI commands (`vercel deploy`, `vercel link`, `vercel inspect`, etc.):

```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>
```

If the project is already linked (`.vercel/project.json` or `.vercel/repo.json` exists), the `orgId` in those files determines the team — no need to ask again. If there is only one team (or just a personal account), skip the prompt and use it directly.

**About the `.vercel/` directory:** A linked project has either:
- `.vercel/project.json` — created by `vercel link` (single project linking). Contains `projectId` and `orgId`.
- `.vercel/repo.json` — created by `vercel link --repo` (repo-based linking). Contains `orgId`, `remoteName`, and a `projects` array mapping directories to Vercel project IDs.

Either file means the project is linked. Check for both. Not needed when `VERCEL_ORG_ID` + `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are both set in the environment.

**Do NOT** use `vercel project inspect`, `vercel ls`, or `vercel link` to detect state in an unlinked directory — without a `.vercel/` config, they will interactively prompt (or with `--yes`, silently link as a side-effect). Only `vercel whoami` is safe to run anywhere.

## Step 2: Choose a Deploy Method

### Quick Deploy (have project ID — no linking needed)

When `VERCEL_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` + `VERCEL_ORG_ID` are set in the environment, deploy directly without linking:

```bash
vercel deploy -y --no-wait
```

With a team scope (either via `VERCEL_ORG_ID` or `--scope`):

```bash
vercel deploy --scope <team-slug> -y --no-wait
```

Production (only when explicitly requested):

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --scope <team-slug> -y --no-wait
```

Check status:

```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

---

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + has git remote → Git Push

This is the ideal state. The project is linked and has git integration.

1. **Ask the user before pushing.** Never push without explicit approval:
   ```
   This project is connected to Vercel via git. I can commit and push to
   trigger a deployment. Want me to proceed?
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "deploy: <description of changes>"
   git push
   ```
   Vercel automatically builds from the push. Non-production branches get preview deployments; the production branch (usually `main`) gets a production deployment.

3. **Retrieve the preview URL.** If the CLI is authenticated:
   ```bash
   sleep 5
   vercel ls --format json
   ```
   The JSON output has a `deployments` array. Find the latest entry — its `url` field is the preview URL.

   If the CLI is not authenticated, tell the user to check the Vercel dashboard or the commit status checks on their git provider for the preview URL.

---

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + no git remote → `vercel deploy`

The project is linked but there's no git repo. Deploy directly with the CLI.

```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait
```

Use `--no-wait` so the CLI returns immediately with the deployment URL instead of blocking until the build finishes (builds can take a while). Then check on the deployment status with:

```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

For production deploys (only if user explicitly asks):
```bash
vercel deploy [path] --prod -y --no-wait
```

---

### Not linked + CLI is authenticated → Link first, then deploy

The CLI is working but the project isn't linked yet. This is the opportunity to get the user into the best state.

1. **Ask the user which team to deploy to.** Present the team slugs from Step 1 as a bulleted list. If there's only one team (or just a personal account), skip this step.

2. **Once a team is selected, proceed directly to linking.** Tell the user what will happen but do not ask for separate confirmation:
   ```
   Linking this project to <team name> on Vercel. This will create a Vercel
   project to deploy to and enable automatic deployments on future git pushes.
   ```

3. **If a git remote exists**, use repo-based linking with the selected team scope:
   ```bash
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug> -y
   ```
   This reads the git remote URL and matches it to existing Vercel projects that deploy from that repo. It creates `.vercel/repo.json`. This is much more reliable than `vercel link` (without `--repo`), which tries to match by directory name and often fails when the local folder and Vercel project are named differently.

   **If there is no git remote**, fall back to standard linking:
   ```bash
   vercel link --scope <team-slug> -y
   ```
   This prompts the user to select or create a project. It creates `.vercel/project.json`.

   **To link to a specific project by name:**
   ```bash
   vercel link --project <project-name> --scope <team-slug> -y
   ```

   If the project is already linked, check `orgId` in `.vercel/project.json` or `.vercel/repo.json` to verify it matches the intended team.

4. **Then deploy using the best available method:**
   - If a git remote exists → commit and push (see git push method above)
   - If no git remote → `vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>`, then `vercel inspect <url>` to check status

---

### Not linked + CLI not authenticated → Install, auth, link, deploy

The Vercel CLI isn't set up at all.

1. **Install the CLI (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Authenticate.** Try token-based auth first (check environment and `.env` files as described in Step 1). If no token is available:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   The user completes auth in their browser. If running in a non-interactive environment where login is not possible, skip to the **no-auth fallback** below.

3. **Ask which team to deploy to** — present team slugs from `vercel teams list --format json` as a bulleted list. If only one team / personal account, skip. Once selected, proceed immediately.

4. **Link the project** with the selected team scope (use `--repo` if a git remote exists, plain `vercel link` otherwise):
   ```bash
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug>   # if git remote exists
   vercel link --scope <team-slug>          # if no git remote
   ```

5. **Deploy** using the best available method (git push if remote exists, otherwise `vercel deploy -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>`, then `vercel inspect <url>` to check status).

---

### Deploying from a Remote Repository (code not cloned locally)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
2. Link to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug> -y
   ```
3. Deploy via git push (if you have push access) or CLI deploy.

---

### No-Auth Fallback — claude.ai sandbox

**When to use:** Last resort when the CLI can't be installed or authenticated in the claude.ai sandbox. This requires no authentication — it returns a **Preview URL** (live site) and a **Claim URL** (transfer to your Vercel account).

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/deploy-to-vercel/resources/deploy.sh [path]
```

**Arguments:**
- `path` - Directory to deploy, or a `.tgz` file (defaults to current directory)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Deploy current directory
bash /mnt/skills/user/deploy-to-vercel/resources/deploy.sh

# Deploy specific project
bash /mnt/skills/user/deploy-to-vercel/resources/deploy.sh /path/to/project

# Deploy existing tarball
bash /mnt/skills/user/deploy-to-vercel/resources/deploy.sh /path/to/project.tgz
```

The script auto-detects the framework from `package.json`, packages the project (excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`), uploads it, and waits for the build to complete.

**Tell the user:** "Your deployment is ready at [previewUrl]. Claim it at [claimUrl] to manage your deployment."

---

### No-Auth Fallback — Codex sandbox

**When to use:** In the Codex sandbox where the CLI may not be authenticated. Codex runs in a sandboxed environment by default — try the CLI first, and fall back to the deploy script if auth fails.

1. **Check whether the Vercel CLI is installed** (no escalation needed for this check):
   ```bash
   command -v vercel
   ```

2. **If `vercel` is installed**, try deploying with the CLI:
   ```bash
   vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait
   ```

3. **If `vercel` is not installed, or the CLI fails with "No existing credentials found"**, use the fallback script:
   ```bash
   skill_dir="<path-to-skill>"

   # Deploy current directory
   bash "$skill_dir/resources/deploy-codex.sh"

   # Deploy specific project
   bash "$skill_dir/resources/deploy-codex.sh" /path/to/project

   # Deploy existing tarball
   bash "$skill_dir/resources/deploy-codex.sh" /path/to/project.tgz
   ```

The script handles framework detection, packaging, and deployment. It waits for the build to complete and returns JSON with `previewUrl` and `claimUrl`.

**Tell the user:** "Your deployment is ready at [previewUrl]. Claim it at [claimUrl] to manage your deployment."

**Escalated network access:** Only escalate the actual deploy command if sandboxing blocks the network call (`sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). Do **not** escalate the `command -v vercel` check.

---

## Managing Environment Variables

```bash
# Set for all environments
echo "value" | vercel env add VAR_NAME --scope <team-slug>

# Set for a specific environment (production, preview, development)
echo "value" | vercel env add VAR_NAME production --scope <team-slug>

# List environment variables
vercel env ls --scope <team-slug>

# Pull env vars to local .env file
vercel env pull --scope <team-slug>

# Remove a variable
vercel env rm VAR_NAME --scope <team-slug> -y
```

## Inspecting Deployments

```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls --format json --scope <team-slug>

# Inspect a specific deployment
vercel inspect <deployment-url>

# View build logs
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

## Managing Domains

```bash
# List domains
vercel domains ls --scope <team-slug>

# Add a domain to the project
vercel domains add <domain> --scope <team-slug>
```

---

## Agent-Specific Notes

### Claude Code / terminal-based agents

You have full shell access. Do NOT use the `/mnt/skills/` path. Follow the decision flow above using the CLI directly.

For the no-auth fallback, run the deploy script from the skill's installed location:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/deploy-to-vercel/resources/deploy.sh [path]
```
The path may vary depending on where the user installed the skill.

### Sandboxed environments (claude.ai)

You likely cannot run `vercel login` or `git push`. Check for `VERCEL_TOKEN` in the environment first. If no token is available, go directly to the **no-auth fallback — claude.ai sandbox**.

### Codex

Codex runs in a sandbox. Check if the CLI is available first, then check for `VERCEL_TOKEN`, then fall back to the deploy script. Go to the **no-auth fallback — Codex sandbox**.

---

## Working Agreement

- **Never pass `VERCEL_TOKEN` as a `--token` flag.** Export it as an environment variable and let the CLI read it natively.
- **Check the environment for tokens before asking the user.** Look in the current env and `.env` files first.
- **Default to preview deployments.** Only deploy to production when explicitly asked.
- **Ask before pushing to git.** Never push commits without the user's approval.
- **Do not read or modify `.vercel/` files directly.** The CLI manages this directory.
- **Do not curl/fetch deployed URLs to verify.** Just return the link to the user.
- **Use `--format json`** when structured output will help with follow-up steps.
- **Use `-y`** on commands that prompt for confirmation to avoid interactive blocking.

---

## Output

Always show the user the deployment URL.

- **Git push:** Use `vercel ls --format json` to find the preview URL. If the CLI isn't authenticated, tell the user to check the Vercel dashboard or commit status checks.
- **CLI deploy:** Show the URL returned by `vercel deploy --no-wait`. Use `vercel inspect <url>` to check build status and report it to the user.
- **No-auth fallback:** Show both the preview URL and the claim URL:
  ```
  Deployment successful!

  Preview URL: https://my-app-abc123.vercel.app
  Claim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...

  View your site at the Preview URL.
  To transfer this deployment to your Vercel account, visit the Claim URL.
  ```

**Do not** curl or fetch the deployed URL to verify it works. Just return the link.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Token not found

Check the environment and any `.env` files present:

```bash
printenv | grep -i vercel
grep -i vercel .env 2>/dev/null
```

### Authentication error

If the CLI fails with `Authentication required`:
- The token may be expired or invalid.
- Verify: `vercel whoami` (uses `VERCEL_TOKEN` from environment).
- Ask the user for a fresh token. They can create one at vercel.com/account/tokens.
- If interactive login is possible, fall back to `vercel login`.

### CLI Auth Failure

If `vercel login` or `vercel deploy` fails with authentication errors, fall back to the no-auth deploy script (claude.ai or Codex variant, depending on the environment).

### Wrong team

Verify the scope is correct:

```bash
vercel whoami --scope <team-slug>
```

### Build failure

Check the build logs:

```bash
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

Common causes:
- Missing dependencies — ensure `package.json` is complete and committed.
- Missing environment variables — add with `vercel env add`.
- Framework misconfiguration — check `vercel.json`. Vercel auto-detects frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Vite, etc.) from `package.json`; override with `vercel.json` if detection is wrong.

### CLI not installed

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Network Egress Error (claude.ai)

If deployment fails due to network restrictions on claude.ai, tell the user:

```
Deployment failed due to network restrictions. To fix this:

1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities
2. Add *.vercel.com to the allowed domains
3. Try deploying again
```

### Escalated Network Access (Codex / sandboxed environments)

If deployment fails due to network issues (timeouts, DNS errors, connection resets) in a sandboxed environment, rerun with escalated permissions (`sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). Do not escalate the initial CLI availability check — only escalate the actual deploy command.

Example guidance to the user:
```
The deploy needs escalated network access to deploy to Vercel. I can rerun
the command with escalated permissions — want me to proceed?
```
